        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am Vilhelm Gustafsson. I have been learning programming in my free
          time since I was 13, and am currently studying programming in high
          school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than programming I am also very interested in trains, japanese
          media such as anime, manga, and
          <ruby>東方 <rp>(</rp><rt>Touhou</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> Project. I also
          like video games, especially rhythm games and games related to my
          other interests.

          This project is a program that can be run on computers in the
          minecraft mod CCTweaked. It allows moving items from a input/output
          chest to an unlimited storage of other chests. Allowing for easy
          storage of items.
          <br />
          I am no longer working on this projects since I use the new storage
          features in the Create mod instead.

        <h3>Schemavisare</h3>

          This project was originally just meant to generate ics files for the
          school schedule. The full schedule is accessible through Skola24, but
          there was no way to add this schedule to phone calendars. After that I
          also added the ability to view the schedule similarly to the Skola24
          schedule viewer, but also adding the id directly to the link so that
          it doesn't have to typed in every time the page loads. It uses
          express.js on the server and generates html on the server with jsx
          syntax.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am currently working on an update that allows users to provide
          custom events and changes to the data that Skola24 provides. With this
          update I am also learning to use the upcoming Temporal API for
          javascript.
